# For new players:
I'd like to share how I approach fighting games. I hope this helps you find a flow for skilling up in your game of choice.

There's 3 major phases for learning a new character or game:
1. Add Option
2. Build Execution
3. Learn Optimization
This loop feeds into itself and has smaller cycles within each step. First I'll outline how the major cycles work together and then I'll explain how each major cycle folds into itself before moving to the next major cycle.

purpose of this new document is to simplify and reorganize the info from the cheatsheet to finalize the cheatsheet into something more useful. This should be a temporary document.

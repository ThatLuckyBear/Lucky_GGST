# For new players:
I'd like to share how I approach fighting games. I hope this helps you find a flow for skilling up in your game of choice. This will be using Guilty Gear Strive for it's examples because it's the game I'm playing now and it's the game I most recently applied this process to.

There's 3 major phases for learning a new character or game:
1. Add Option
2. Build Execution
3. Learn Optimization
This loop feeds into itself and has smaller cycles within each step. First I'll outline how the major cycles work together and then I'll explain how each major cycle folds into itself before moving to the next major cycle.

## Add Option
This is where you start. Simply put: learn what you can do and when. You start small and work your way up. This can mean combos, techniques, controller layouts, etc.  
There are universals to this like: round start, wakeup, your opponent's wakeup, and blocked DP. You learn your option for each within the game and within your character. Once you have a decent stack of options to practice move on to execution. At first you'll have a big stack of options to learn but as you get better you'll probably only be working on learning/building 1 or 2 new options at a time. 
## Build Execution
This is where you practice your options. Learn how to execute not just in training mode but also transferring that to real game matches. Once you can do what you want when you want most of the time and you're not actively trying to remember what to do or how you're ready for the next bit.
## Learn Optimization
Learn the best way to do something. Don't think of "optimized" as "most damage." Instead think "most effective" If something is too execution heavy try to simplify. If you're dropping a combo try to find a more consistent version or method. Are your inputs as clean as possible? Is there a better way to input an option (plink/double tap/frame kills?) If you find something add the option (1) and/or build execution (2) If you're done optimizing it's time to add some new options.


purpose of this new document is to simplify and reorganize the info from the cheatsheet to finalize the cheatsheet into something more useful. This should be a temporary document.

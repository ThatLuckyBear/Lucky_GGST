Documenting my journey going from "free" and unable to engage with GGST mechanics to my current state: Not terrible.


Goals:
Show how I progressed with my gameplay to be consistently floor 10+
Show each step and how I figured out that step before moving to the next to create a path for new players


# I have a lot of video that I can use to get a good idea of my journey if I get lost. Here's my first stab at it   
Also use my githib commits to see what I've changed along the way while I learn. Way better tbh.
- just pressing buttons
  - this section was really jsut learning how the game feels and what buttons feel strong and how easy combos were
  - conclusions: not easy really fast and awkward
- trying to do basic combos (and failing)
  - tried doing c.s > 5.HS > tatami > 2S and it never worked (wonder why!)
- learning a combo (actually) and trying
  - learned that c.s > 6H and 5H is not the move
  - learned that c.s > 2H > tatami > 2S > 426HH was strong
  - learned my strong jump options (j.S & j.p)
  - learned to air dash j.s > Youz
- hitting combos consistently in matches
  - learning how to confirm a random counterhit f.s > 2H > 426HH > RRC > c.s > 6H 426HH to add damage
  - learning how to finish combos with  tatami > 2S >super to get more damage
- learning some frame traps
  - f.s > 2H
  - j.S > youz
  - 6K > tatami
  - c.s > c.s 
- learning safejumps
  - from tatmami (HS)
  - from 426HH (IAD tatami)
- learning overhead ladder combo from yzn
  - lots of troubleshooting
- learning RPS from c.s
- learning how to dash up 5k to start RPS
- learning how to dash up throw and get the RPS going
- learning how to throw as part of RPS mix
-

Documenting my journey going from "free" and unable to engage with GGST mechanics to my current state: Not terrible.


Goals:
Show how I progressed with my gameplay to be consistently floor 10+
Show each step and how I figured out that step before moving to the next to create a path for new players

# My Journey With Baiken
Using my notes I have a pretty good idea of my journey with Baiken so I'm going to share it to give you an idea of how I progressed from "never played a Guilty Gear game" to Celestial.

### About me as a player
I am an '09er so I've been playing fighting games seriously since about then. Nearly 20 years of experience definitely plays a factor in my ability to improve in any given game. I also have a lifetime of enjoying fighting games since the 90s although I only ever played them casually. I am not excellent at fighting games by any means but I do like learning them and playing them. I use a Smashbox controller which is a leverless controller. Since I have no aspirations to enter tournaments my setup is not legal (I have two up buttons) but it is otherwise the same as any other controller. I honestly just love the design of the Smashbox and I fell in love with leverless controllers after getting it too.

### Guilty Gear and Me
I started playing Guilty Gear on the 27th of March and I successfully completed the Celestial challenge on the 9th of September. I have always loved Baiken's design and was drawn to her since before I knew how to play Guilty Gear. I did try an older ps2 game as well as xrd but I never got very far with the game and quit before learning anything meaningful. I am a Dad and I only really play during the baby's nap which means all of my progress was gained playing about 1 hour a day 5 days a week for the few months it took to reach Celestial. I am quitting Guilty Gear as of this writing because honestly competitive games and my emotional sensitivities do not mix. If I'm having a bad day competitive online games will make it worse even if I'm winning. I've been going through a rough patch mentally so I'm gonna write up a few things about GGST and start using this large chunk of time on other projects.

### Learing Fighting Games - My Process
I learn fighting games by taking thorough notes while playing, engaging with the community, and utilizing a training system I call the "3 Step Cycle." The cycle goes: 1) Learn new options 2) Execute Those Options 3) Optimize your play. Each step feeds into the next and there are smaller learning cycles within each step that help me get through skill barriers. Simply put I write stuff down when I'm confused and try to find answers by looking online or asking the community. When I find the answer I add it to my list of things to learn and practice it until I can do it in a real match instead of training mode. From there I try to find the best way to utilize the option by trying different versions, sometimes a lower damage option is more consistent so that is optimal to me. Another optimization is testing your inputs and seeing if theres a more comfortable way to press the buttons how you like. Optimization often reveals new options you can learn so you start the process over. Practice makes perfect and if I drop something in a game or feel like I'm scrambling around my controller instead of smoothly inputting each step in a combo/setup I revisit my execution in traning a bit to polish up.

### List
this list will be likely not be in the final draft since it's more for my personal use. Here's all the progress I made. This is following my notes.
+ 3/27 Started playing and learned some basic combos and approach tools.
+ 3/28 I was using j.s > Youzensan to great effect and was already trying to learn a high low mix but I couldn't do it. I was also constantly dropping a combo that didn't work. I was also looking at my buttons and learning which were fastest (5p) and what might not be smart to use consistently (2H). I remember I was using Dustloop at this point and I was unsure if the information was accurate because I couldn't do most of the combos and didn't have the skills to troubleshoot. Punish combo in my notes: c.S > 5H > 41236H~H IF DASHING = c.s > f.s > 5h > 41236~H
+ 4/1-4/5 I found some Reddit threads and learned I could 236P for a 1 frame counter. Around now I started looking into frame traps, poke conversions, anti air combos/crossup answers, and I put the "mixup" at the top of my list. I wanted to learn rock paper scissors since I knew it'd give me an edge. I added the following combos to my arsenal and started practicing:
  + 236k > 2S > kibari 
  + c.S > 2H > Tatami > 2S > Kibari || I dropped this CONSTANTLY and would routinely try to do it off f.s which is actually impossible.
  + [CH] f.S > 2H > Kibari
  +

<details><summary>First Draft</summary>
  I have a lot of video that I can use to get a good idea of my journey if I get lost. Here's my first stab at it   
Also use my githib commits to see what I've changed along the way while I learn. Way better tbh.
- just pressing buttons
  - this section was really jsut learning how the game feels and what buttons feel strong and how easy combos were
  - conclusions: not easy really fast and awkward
- trying to do basic combos (and failing)
  - tried doing c.s > 5.HS > tatami > 2S and it never worked (wonder why!)
- learning a combo (actually) and trying
  - learned that c.s > 6H and 5H is not the move
  - learned that c.s > 2H > tatami > 2S > 426HH was strong
  - learned my strong jump options (j.S & j.p)
  - learned to air dash j.s > Youz
- hitting combos consistently in matches
  - learning how to confirm a random counterhit f.s > 2H > 426HH > RRC > c.s > 6H 426HH to add damage
  - learning how to finish combos with  tatami > 2S >super to get more damage
- learning some frame traps
  - f.s > 2H
  - j.S > youz
  - 6K > tatami
  - c.s > c.s 
- learning safejumps
  - from tatmami (HS)
  - from 426HH (IAD tatami)
- learning overhead ladder combo from yzn
  - lots of troubleshooting
- learning RPS from c.s
- learning how to dash up 5k to start RPS
- learning how to dash up throw and get the RPS going
- learning how to throw as part of RPS mix

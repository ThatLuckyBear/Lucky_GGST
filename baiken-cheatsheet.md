## Essential Combos:
Tatami > 2S > Kibari
- when tethered every button combos into this
- tags onto the end of most combos

c.S > 2H > Tatami > 2S > Kibari {true}
- need to be SO close but it works great

{COUNTER} f.S > 2H > Kibari
- reactable to Counterhit don't just press buttons.

{COUNTER} 2S > 2H > Kibari
- free air dash combo if you overextend
  
2K > 2D > Tatami > f.S
- low combo
- replace f.S with super for damage

Crossup YOUZ > Kibari
- airdash YOUZ is kinda free and it ground bounces on crossup

## Silly combos
IAS YOUZ > pistol super > 2k > sword Super

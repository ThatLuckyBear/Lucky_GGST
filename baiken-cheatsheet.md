</details>

Feels safe but isn't
- second hit of kibari can be interrupted, thrown, super'd and all that
- the block string including tatami can definitely be super'd and iframe'd through with a super but it seems inconsistent (test)

## working on c.s > IA.YOUZ
after the blocked c.s input the YOUZ and hold up and forward delaying the S slightly to make YOUZ come out
66RRC is realy really hard to do right now I'm doing 66 but dash 
you can use dash button by hitting P S HS and 66 at once but I;m scared of bursting? (test)
to stop super jump try holding down during the YOUZ (DOESNT WORK makes it worse because SCOD)


## Working on Kara Kibari
5k to kibari after the basic 5p punish combo is possible but very hard

Cancel the 5k with a dash (66) and cancel the dash with Kibari (41236.HS)

tips:
holding forward (6) and HS makes it easier to execute the kibari
you have to hit the 5k very soon after tatami but a small frame gap is needed between 5k and dash
do not input the half circle until you've already pressed 5k, there's plenty of time and its easy to lose the buffer for kibari if you do it too early (hold HS!)
plink isn't required and it works well just pressing the buttons with two fingers one after the other (holding HS after dash
if mashing the HS for the second hit of Kibari it will whiff, just react and it will be fine the backend of the input window is way larger than the front.
indicators of execution:
- there is a bit of a dust or flash at the feet when the dash starts.
- If you execute the dash cancel but don't do kibari you probably didn't hold HS and/or may have flubbed your half circle input
- if the 5k doesn't come out you pressed it too quickly
- if the dash cancel doesn't come out you pressed the dash too early (slight delay after 5k is necessary)


## Working on anti air
When doing the 6p input the kibari with delay input the QCF twice and press HS on the second.
- 6P does notcombo without counter
- (HIGH UP) 6p > Kibari (first hit) > 2k > Sword Super
- (LOW DOWN) 6p > Kibari (both hits) > RRC > Sword Super

## Working on safejump
Tatami > IAD > HS is a safejump and I think 100% of the time?? I need to check.
- Block? Punish with 6S and do tatami loop
- Hit with HS? IDK what to do yet!!
HS Kibari + followup > IAD Tatami
- invincible moves will beat you if you mash
- confirm block before schmix
- if blocked c.s into high low
- if hit go into c.s > h.S > Kibari or cs. > 6k > tatami for more pressure

## working on mixup from c.s (also 5k!)
#### High = Youz
- cannot combo without roman cancel
- take a healthy delay before TK.YOUZ, c.s hitstun is legendary but the gatling to f.s threatens to steal your inputs
- 66RRC will set you up for the combo (beware of burst!)
- Combo: [2]369S > 66FRRC > j.H > jc > j.S > j.H > j.236K > c.S > 6H* > 41236H~H
  - *use 2H instead of 6H if you end up near the corner
#### Frame Traps
- Three good options
  - c.s again is pretty legit this will punish a throw attempt as you'll be out of throw range and a counterhit goes into 2H or RRC shenanigans
  - 6H is a 4 frame trap
  - Tatami is a 2 frame trap

## Essential Combos:
Tatami > 2S > Kibari
- when tethered every button combos into this
- tags onto the end of most combos

c.S > 2H > Tatami > 2S > Kibari {true}
- need to be SO close but it works great

{COUNTER} f.S > 2H > Kibari
- reactable to Counterhit don't just press buttons.

{COUNTER} 2S > 2H > Kibari
- IAD > tatami is a safejump if timed correctly (not hard)
- if you overextend with c.s you can get hit with invincible wakeup moves so blocking is a good idea mix it up
  
2K > 2D > Tatami > f.S
- low combo confirm (2D is unsafe so check your hits)
- replace f.S with super for damage

Crossup YOUZ > Kibari
- airdash YOUZ is kinda free and it ground bounces on crossup

## Silly combos
IAS YOUZ > pistol super > 2k > sword Super

Buttons Breakdown
  
Neutral
You can press a lot of buttons 
- c.s
  - combos into 5H > Kibari
  - jump cancels on block or hit for schmixin
    - empty jump low/throw
    - crossup YOUZ (Forward jump) **TEST**
    - front YOUZ or j.H (neutral jump) **TEST**
- f.s
  - no combo! (tatami if tethered!)
  - counterhit combos into 2H > Kibari + followup
- 5H
  - Slower than f.s but slightly disjointed
  - combos into Kibari
- 2HS (Unsafe)
  - combos into Kibari
- Kibari (H or S)
- j.s > YOUZ
- j.HS
Defensive
  On wakeup or When being rushed on
- 5p is the fastest button (4 frames)
- 236P for 1 frame reversal with tight timing
  -On wakeup or when opponent is mashing
  - very unsafe but powerful forces respect
- 
  
Offensive
- Opponent Wakeup
  - 2k > 5D

Combos:
  Standing/Blocking = c.S > 5H > 41236H~H 
  IF DASHING = c.s > f.s > 5h > 41236~H

## Gameplan:
f.s is great in neutral and leads to 2HS > Kibari on counter hit
after tatami safejump is IAD > HS
after Kibari safejump is IAD > Tatami

## Practice:
- Mixup
- Counterhit Tatami Combo (long float)
- IAS/TN YOUZ (avoid super jump version )
- Frame Traps
- Poke conversion (into tether or other)
- Anti Air (especially crossups!)
- 
### Press button recieve damage
If opponent is tethered tatami after landing a poke
if you hit j.s you can confirm to j.d 
if you air throw into the corner: 
[rrc] or [prc] j.s > j.d > 66 > j.s > j.d > YOUZ > WS > J.D (162) --- dont hold forward on the last hit you'll do an air throw (gatling doesn't allow airthrow to come out so it's easy to do by mistake)


## Matchups

## anji
it's insanely hard to time wakeup counter because hes so wonky, (mash harder?)
his blockstrings are really tight so theres almost no space to counter
you gotta hold the block string and reversal (5p) when you can
air fan doesnt have a hitbox in air so jump to punish

## aba
if you block a close overhead you can punish with 5p but only on dookie mode

## axl
really tricky blockstrings make it hard to find gaps 
guess if hes gonna go high or low and work within those parameters
everything seems meaty from any distance so there isn't a lot you can do from afar on wakeup
not advisable to use 2HS
not advisable to use wakeup counter
his jumpback swipey move will not bew caught by super (sword) so don't go for it.
his spinny spin is safe once it ends punish during with kibari
(test) try 6p against some stuff
can punish a lot from long range since his normals are not disjointed!
(test) followups from after his jump back thing might have a gap for counter 


## Bedman
2HS gets blown up becaues they can covert easily from ariel attacks
there are definitely holes in block strings to mash 5p but they need to be labbed (test)
has a really nasty round start (6p maybe) that will destroy you if you jump but can be beat with 2HS


## Bridget
monster lots of high low and command throw mixups but there are definitely holes in offense.

## chipp
hes gonna getcha. not matter how far he looks he can hit you 100%
is he left or right? DUNNO!! LOL!!
confirms are abosolutely essential
when in the corner he can crossup easily
hes squishy but has guts so he can hang on sometimes when health is low, go for bigger damage combos just to be sure
tatami helps a lot but it isn't a cure all
he has a directly straight down dive kick so don't challenge him without purpose
if hes invisible you can hit him but dont risk it for the buscuit
counter is useless on wakeup but good during block strings (alpha blade cannot be countered)
When does his turn end?
- when he does X?

## faust
his anti air 6p hits low enough to counterhit 2HS soooo you cant low profile it to punish a bad aa guess

## Goldlewis
deceptively long range
can delay meaty, very tricky to counter
seeming has limited wakeup options (test)

## happy chaos
this duuuude shoots you a lot and has a schmixup game. It's hard to find holes but there are ways of getting through.
if you have been hit with the stinky bomb then the bullets will autotrack super hard
if you're not stinky you can jump or run through since they have to "aim" the shot - mix it up

## ino
when note pressure is in play you can definitely parry some of the options but others are true block strings 
ino seems to be able to throw on the meaty setup off 5p>6k>TATAMI but IDK why (test)
- after testing I immediately got a counterhit which is uHHHHh interesting? IDK what I'm doing wrong in match.
if you cause a whiff on the ground slide stab you can't hit with an ariel ino will get you with an anti air counterhit
ino does a really big wind up move in the air that causes a staggar state, can probably 6p on reaction while it charges? (test)
might be able to 6p all over the place tbh idk.
can you counterhit the slide stab? (test)

## jacko
can you punish their slide attack? (test)
can't do anything when you're getting robotted 


## ky kiske
fuck this guy hes so fast and just does whatever he wants. 
if close you can wakeup super his charged up fireballs
if hes doing air fireballs you can run under it if you notice soon enough
if he gets hit the fireballs go away 
flip klic beats almost everything and will catch neautral jump
- you can counter
- you can 6p
if you get hit with basically anything for blockstun you cannot get away
you can't do air tatami without a backdash becaue he can run in and anti air for a counterhit combo
kibari in neutral is good but cant be relied on
2HS can be counterhit very easily so beware 
when getting super smashed through the wall you cannot 2p the incoming ariel (i know i can fucking parry it but I got caught anyway... execution probably.)

## may
overwhelming in the right hands 
important to know when to press buttons 
kibari works to shut down some rushdown but it's limited since she can approach easily from the sky
2S is sometimes solid when both on ground but limited
CONSTANT high low, every approach is another mixup so don't sleep (downback and react high?)
may has a big upswing that you CANNOT go under with 2HS (kibari)


## millia
use 5p in scrambles and confirm into pressure
her buttons are crazy and you cant tell if shes left or right so uhhhh don't guess just press jab or block
might be weak to grabs on their pressure (test)


# Potempkin
when he does drive rush you can probably counter the second hit with delay (test)
always burst after garuda hits or you eat a pot buster
even if you 
never jump unless absolutely necessary
you can react and do a counter when he does meaty garuda usually
you cannot go under mega fisto with 2HS

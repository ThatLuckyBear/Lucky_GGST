## Working on anti air
When doing the 6p input the kibari with delay input the QCF twice and press HS on the second.
- 6P does notcombo without counter
- (HIGH UP) 6p > Kibari (first hit) > 2k > Sword Super
- (LOW DOWN) 6p > Kibari (both hits) > RRC > Sword Super

## Working on safejump
Tatami > IAD > HS is a safejump and I think 100% of the time?? I need to check.
- Block? Punish with 6S and do tatami loop
- Hit with HS? IDK what to do yet!!
HS Kibari + followup > IAD Tatami
- invincible moves will beat you if you mash
- confirm block before schmix
- if blocked c.s into high low
- if hit go into c.s > h.S > Kibari or cs. > 6k > tatami for more pressure

## Essential Combos:
Tatami > 2S > Kibari
- when tethered every button combos into this
- tags onto the end of most combos

c.S > 2H > Tatami > 2S > Kibari {true}
- need to be SO close but it works great

{COUNTER} f.S > 2H > Kibari
- reactable to Counterhit don't just press buttons.

{COUNTER} 2S > 2H > Kibari
- free air dash combo if you overextend
  
2K > 2D > Tatami > f.S
- low combo confirm (2D is unsafe so check your hits)
- replace f.S with super for damage

Crossup YOUZ > Kibari
- airdash YOUZ is kinda free and it ground bounces on crossup

## Silly combos
IAS YOUZ > pistol super > 2k > sword Super

Buttons Breakdown
  
Neutral
You can press a lot of buttons 
- c.s
  - combos into 5H > Kibari
  - jump cancels on block or hit for schmixin
    - empty jump low/throw
    - crossup YOUZ (Forward jump) **TEST**
    - front YOUZ or j.H (neutral jump) **TEST**
- f.s
  - no combo! (tatami if tethered!)
  - counterhit combos into 2H > Kibari + followup
- 5H
  - Slower than f.s but slightly disjointed
  - combos into Kibari
- 2HS (Unsafe)
  - combos into Kibari
- Kibari (H or S)
- j.s > YOUZ
- j.HS
Defensive
  On wakeup or When being rushed on
- 5p is the fastest button (4 frames)
- 236P for 1 frame reversal with tight timing
  -On wakeup or when opponent is mashing
  - very unsafe but powerful forces respect
- 
  
Offensive
- Opponent Wakeup
  - 2k > 5D

Combos:
  Standing/Blocking = c.S > 5H > 41236H~H 
  IF DASHING = c.s > f.s > 5h > 41236~H

## Gameplan:
f.s is great in neutral and leads to 2HS > Kibari on counter hit
after tatami safejump is IAD > HS
after Kibari safejump is IAD > Tatami

## Practice:
- Mixup
- Counterhit Tatami Combo (long float)
- IAS/TN YOUZ (avoid super jump version )
- Frame Traps
- Poke conversion (into tether or other)
- Anti Air (especially crossups!)
- 
### Press button recieve damage
If opponent is tethered tatami after landing a poke
if you hit j.s you can confirm to j.d 
if you air throw into the corner: 
[rrc] or [prc] j.s > j.d > 66 > j.s > j.d > YOUZ > WS > J.D (162) --- dont hold forward on the last hit you'll do an air throw (gatling doesn't allow airthrow to come out so it's easy to do by mistake)


## Matchups
## Bridget
monster lots of high low and command throw mixups but there are definitely holes in offense.


## happy chaos
this duuuude shoots you a lot and has a schmixup game. It's hard to find holes but there are ways of getting through.
if you have been hit with the stinky bomb then the bullets will autotrack super hard
if you're not stinky you can jump or run through since they have to "aim" the shot - mix it up

## millia
use 5p in scrambles and confirm into pressure
her buttons are crazy and you cant tell if shes left or right so uhhhh don't guess just press jab or block

## chipp
hes gonna getcha. not matter how far he looks he can hit you 100%
is he left or right? DUNNO!! LOL!!
confirms are abosolutely essential
when in the corner he can crossup easily
hes squishy but has guts so he can hang on sometimes when health is low, go for bigger damage combos just to be sure
tatami helps a lot but it isn't a cure all
he has a directly straight down dive kick so don't challenge him without purpose
if hes invisible you can hit him but dont risk it for the buscuit
counter is useless on wakeup but good during block strings (alpha blade cannot be countered)
When does his turn end?
- when he does X?

# Potempkin
always burst after garuda hits or you eat a pot buster
never jump unless absolutely necessary
you can react and do a counter when he does meaty garuda usually
